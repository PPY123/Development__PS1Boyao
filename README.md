PS1_solutionBoyao.py is the final code document for solving the PS.

All the do files are used to collect the new dataset.

ps1_data.csv is the old dataset which is used for most of the PS.(Not resonable some mistakes for sure)

cropid_itmcd.dta is computed for running one of the do files and collecting the new dataset.
